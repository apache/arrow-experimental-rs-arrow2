/// Applies an unary and infalible function to a primitive array.
/// This is the fastest way to perform an operation on a primitive array when
/// the benefits of a vectorized operation outweights the cost of branching nulls and non-nulls.
/// # Implementation
/// This will apply the function for all values, including those on null slots.
/// This implies that the operation must be infalible for any value of the corresponding type
/// or this function may panic.

    // JUSTIFICATION
    //  Benefit
    //      ~60% speedup
    //  Soundness
    //      `values` is an iterator with a known size because arrays are sized.
